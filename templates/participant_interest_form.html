		<h3>FAQ</h3>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q1. How much will I have to participate?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans.</strong> Your active participation in PhoneLab will be limited to a few hours a month. Most of the time you’ll just be using your phone normally.
		</p>
			<br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q2. How long do I have to remain a part of the testbed?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>We are preferring students willing to continue to participate in PhoneLab for three or four years, and so we actively recruiting freshman, sophomores, and incoming PhD students. We want participants to stick around so that we can provide a stable pool to experimenters and so that the testbed grows in size.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q3. If I leave the testbed after one year, can I keep the Android smartphone?</i></strong><br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>No. If you leave after one year, we will require you to return your smartphone so that it can be used by another participant.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140%; font-size: 18px ;'>
			<strong><i>Q4. I’m already on a family plan. Should I join the testbed?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>We’re offering free voice and data for one year and deep discounts in future years. At some point you will leave your family plan, and maybe now is the time to do it? Give your parents and siblings back your share of the minutes, texts, and megabytes!
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140%; font-size: 18px ;'>
			<strong><i>Q5. I don’t want to change my number! Can I still be a part of the testbed?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>Yes! You can definitely port your number to Google Voice and then associate your new phone with your Google Voice account. This is probably the most flexible option, since it allows you to easily switch numbers in the future. We are also exploring whether you will be able to port your number directly to Sprint if you so desire.
		</p><br>	
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q6. What’s in it for me?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong> Ans.</strong> First, we’ll provide a brand new Android Nexus S smartphone for you to use. Second, during your first year in the testbed you receive unlimited voice, data and messaging absolutely free. You will never receive a bill. Finally, after your first year we will transition you into a special deely-discounted plan offered by Sprint only to PhoneLab participants and you’ll continue to save money each month. Over four years in PhoneLab, you’ll save over $2,000.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q7. So who’s paying for my phone?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans.</strong> PhoneLab is funded by the National Science Foundation—your tax dollars at work—and made possible by generous discounts provided by Sprint.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q8. Am I required to participate in experiments?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>Yes, PhoneLab participants are required to continue to participate in some experiments. You may, however, decline to participate in specific experiments if you do not feel comfortable with the data that they are collecting about you.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q9. What does participation entail?</i></strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Ans. </strong>For at most a few hours a month you’ll use your phone to interact with experimental applications. All participation will happen using your phone, not in any other way: no reports, mandatory meetings, or anything like that. Here’s some examples of things you might do as a PhoneLab participant:<br>
				<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>a.</b> Complete a survey on your phone.<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b.</b>Use a geotagging smartphone application on campus.</br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>c.</b>Evaluate a new classroom interaction application in one of your UB courses.</p>
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q10. How will I know what information experiments are collecting about me?</i></strong><br>
			<strong>Ans.</strong> When experiments begin to run they will display the standard Android permissions dialog indicating what permissions the experiment is requesting. If you do not feel comfortable with the permissions requested by an experiment, you may decline to participate.
		</p><br>
		<p style='line-height: 140% ; font-size: 18px;'>
			<strong><i>Q11. Is PhoneLab safe?</i></strong><br>
			<strong> Ans.</strong> Yes. Experimental applications may only use data that you grant them access to. In addition, all experiments must be approved by a university Institutional Review Board (IRB) for human subjects procedures compliance before they may be run on PhoneLab. Together with the IRB, the PhoneLab team will ensure that experiments only collect data absolutely necessary to test their hypotheses. These extra controls make PhoneLab applications substantially safer than ones that you download online through the Android Marketplace or other app store.
